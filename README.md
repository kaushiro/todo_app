# 4C Platform Frontend Technical Test

Create a `ToDoList` React application that holds a list of `ToDoItem`s ordered in chronological order. The `ToDoItem`s are added via a form. Each `ToDoItem` must have a title, timestamp and a solve button. When an item is solved, the title must appear as line through text and the item will move at the end of the list.

The application must make use of a `ToDoContext` that holds the state of the application. The state can be accessed and altered via the `useContext` hook. A `ToDoProvider` must make use of a `useReducer` hook and a reducer that helps modifying the state based on events and payload. Where appropriate, `useEffect` and `useState` hooks can be used.

**Please note:** All constructs **must** be implemented as **functional styled components** (conditional styles, etc..) and be **unit tested** using Jest and React Testing Library, with a **minimum coverage of 80%**.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
